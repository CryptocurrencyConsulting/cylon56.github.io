title: How EIPs Become a Fork
subtitle: Musings on Ethereum's governance and decision making
---

Governance is difficult. Change is difficult. These things are especially difficult in the context of blockchains. I am currently helping organize ['Metropolis'](https://www.ethnews.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-gives-keynote-on-metropolis), the next major update to the Ethereum blockchain. Decision making processes can be very confusing in blockchain ecosystems, so I wanted to highlight some of my thoughts on where we are now and where we are going.

## Some Context

Ethereum is a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a reference client. It has [a specification](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) that is followed by any teams that wants to implment an Ethereum client that is compatible to the specification and network rules. There are multiple Ethereum clients built in a variety of programming languages such as Rust, Go, C++, Python, and Java. Certain features and improvements to the Ethereum blockchain can only be added via an upgrade, or "hard fork". The next three sections outlines how proposals for Ethereum improvements are presented, discussed, and implemented.

## EIPs

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are a documents that describe a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. EIPs have different
